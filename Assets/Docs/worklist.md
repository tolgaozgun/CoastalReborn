## M0 — Bootstrap Refactor (Deterministic Startup) ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Goal:** Replace singletons & scattered Awake/Start with a single async startup sequence and DI-driven initialization. Game loads into Harbor with a boat and Tablet UI opening.

### Deliverables (Definition of Done) ✅
- ✅ Empty **Bootstrap** scene with **one** object: `GameInitiator`.
- ✅ DI container created; **CoreContext** services bound.
- ✅ Loading screen displayed, Harbor scene loaded additively, **GameplayContext** bound, loading screen closed.
- ✅ Player boat moves; Tablet opens/closes; no singletons/DontDestroyOnLoad used by gameplay systems.

### Worklist & To-Dos
- **Project Setup**
  - ✅ Create **Bootstrap** scene (empty).
  - ✅ Remove `_Core` scene & Singleton patterns from managers.
  - ✅ Create **assembly definitions**: `Core.asmdef`, `Gameplay.asmdef`, `UI.asmdef`, `Shared.asmdef`.
        *Rule:* `Gameplay` depends on `Core`; `Core` cannot reference `Gameplay`.
  - ✅ Input System enabled; create **InputActions** asset (`Navigation`, `Tablet`, `Pause`).
- **DI & Entry Flow**
  - ✅ Create **DI Container** (service registration, resolution; full implementation with lifetimes).
  - ✅ Define **CoreContext** registrations: Input, UI, Save, Intel, Upgrades, Tablet Service, Audio (if any).
  - ✅ Define **GameplayContext** registrations: Ship Spawner/Pool, Suspicion, Event Director, Patrol Director.
  - ✅ Document **Initialization Phases**: _Bind → Instantiate (UI, pools) → Initialize (services) → Create (assets/content) → Prepare (place, wire) → Reveal → Start_.
- **Scenes & Loading**
  - ✅ Create **HarborScene** (flat water, a dock, clear navigation space).
  - ✅ Create **SceneLoader** service (design: additive load, active scene set, unload non-active except Bootstrap).
  - ✅ Loading Screen prefab: world-agnostic overlay; shows progress bar & status text.
- **Prefabs & Components (design only)**
  - ✅ `PlayerBoat`: Rigidbody boat controller; camera follow; input routing.
  - ✅ `TabletCanvas`: Canvas, tab buttons (Contracts, Intel, Upgrades, Crew, Settings), modal stack policy.
  - ✅ Basic dock and water setup in HarborScene.
- **QA / Acceptance**
  - ✅ Enter Play → instantaneous Bootstrap load → Loading screen visible → HarborScene loads within 1s on dev machine.
  - ✅ WASD boat movement working; input system integrated.
  - ✅ Tablet UI framework ready (basic implementation).

# Cross-Cutting Technical Checklists

## A. Services & Contexts
- [ ] All systems expose **interfaces**; concrete implementations bound in container.
- [ ] **CoreContext**: Input, UI, Save, Intel, Upgrades, Tablet, Audio.
- [ ] **GameplayContext**: ShipManager/Pool, Suspicion, Patrol, EventDirector, Chase, Arrest.
- [ ] **No MonoBehaviour** runs critical logic in `Awake/Start`; only `Initialize()` via entry flow.

## B. Prefab Rules
- [ ] Prefabs are **pure data + components**; no global access.
- [ ] Script references acquired via **injection** or **initializer methods** at spawn.
- [ ] Layer & Tag matrix documented (Ship, PlayerShip, Dock, ScanTarget, UI).

## C. Input & UI
- [ ] Separate input maps for Navigation vs Tablet; context switching enforced by UI Manager.
- [ ] One source of truth for modal stack; Tablet never overlaps destructive dialogs.
- [ ] Controller navigation routes defined per panel.

## D. Telemetry & Debug
- [ ] On-screen debug toggles: suspicion breakdown, scanner heat, region influence.
- [ ] Event log panel: inspections resolved, scans, arrests, faction changes.
- [ ] Designer console commands (non-shipping): spawn smuggler, set influence, trigger event.

## E. Balancing Hooks
- [ ] All key numbers (weights, timers, cooldowns, spawn rates) in **ScriptableObjects**.
- [ ] `Tuning` folder with curated presets (Casual, Default, Hardcore).

---

# Risks & Mitigations
- **Race conditions reintroduced by stray components** → *CI check / GUID search for Awake/Start usage in gameplay scripts; review gates.*
- **DI sprawl** → *Group bindings in Installer classes per context; keep surface area small.*
- **Network desync** → *Authoritative host; clients only send inputs; state replicated from services.*
- **UI complexity** → *Strict modal policy; always-visible breadcrumbs; limit nested dialogs to 2 levels.*

---

# Minimal Success Path (Playtestable at Each Milestone)
- **M0–M1**: Boat + Tablet UI navigable (management stubs).
- **M2–M3**: Inspect → Scan → Evidence loop feels like a game.
- **M4**: Patrol → Chase → Board → Arrest constitutes a complete session.
- **M5–M6**: Adaptive factions + deeper documents add replay variety.
- **M7–M9**: Co-op + upgrades + dynamic events create a living loop.
- **M10**: Save/load + perf polish → production-ready backbone.
